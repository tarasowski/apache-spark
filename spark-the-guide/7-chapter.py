# Aggregations
# Aggregation is the act of collecting something together
# In an aggregation you will specify a key or grouping and an aggregation function that specifies how you should transform one or more columns
# This function must produce one result for each group, given multiple input values
# You use aggregation to summarize numerical data usually by means of some grouping:
#   - This might be a summation
#   - A product
#   - Simple counting
# Also w/ Spark you can aggregate any kind of value into an array, list or map
